# Accounting
Reads text files and sorts through data
Inspiration for this came through my parents (small business owners) talking about how useful it would be to have a program that basically does the accounting for them. So that's what this program aims to do. It looks at a text file with all the expenses in it and sorts them into new text files it creates. It also totals expenses of the same kind.
