# Accounting
Reads text files and sorts through data
Inspiration for this came through my parents (small business owners) talking about how useful it would be to have a program that basically does the accounting for them. So that's what this program aims to do. It looks at a text file with all the expenses in it and sorts them into new text files it creates. It also totals expenses of the same kind.

As long as you have a program that runs C++, just copy paste the code and you're good to go!
Make sure you save the text file you want to organize in the same folder you store the code. If the code is on your desktop, the file should be as well.
